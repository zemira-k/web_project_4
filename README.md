## Web Project 4 - Zemira Kehati

## Project Name: Around The U.S.

## Project description and its functionality: 
* In the header there is a logo with the name of the project. 
* The Profile section contains an image-avatar, a name of a person and his task/job, an edit button, and an add button.
* There is a form that pups up when clicking the edit button. in the form the user can type a name and task to edit the page. when clicking save or "x" button the form is closed.
* A grid of 6 photoes of places and their name with a heart to click for "like". 
* And a footer with copyright.

## Technologies and techniques used: 
* Some parts are arranged with flex, and others with grid. 
* In html I used tags like - body, main. footer, section, img, a, p, form, button, input.. 
* Each block and element has a class. 
* All classes are arranged in folders and files according to BEM. 

### In css I used - 
* Percentage width for block classes, so the page will be responsive. 
* Grid for the six elements of images. Arranged them with grid-template-column, grid-template-rows and grid gap. 
* Media queries for breaking points. 
* The pseudo class "hover" for all the links.

### In JS I used - 
* function for opening and closing and submiting the form.
