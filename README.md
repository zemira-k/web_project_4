### Technologies and techniques used: 
* BEM metodologi.
* Popup windows.
* Template elements.

### In css I used - 
* Percentage width for block classes, so the page will be responsive. 
* Grid for the six elements of images. Arranged them with grid-template-column, grid-template-rows and grid gap. 
* Media queries for breaking points. 
* The pseudo class "hover" for all the links.
* Transition for opening and closing forms images etc.

### In JS I used -

* Function for opening, closing and submiting all the forms.
* A function for all the cards events.
